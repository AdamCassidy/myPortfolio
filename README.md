A responsive social media forum that's focused on discussion of constructive feedback. It was made with Vue.js and Firebase. It uses Vuex to manage state and makes RESTful API calls to Firebase's realtime database where it holds user's content. It uses Firebase's authentication service and funnels alert messages from them. The app also uses custom form validation of its own to get the full authentication flow. Users can upload avatars, or images to their posts, and they are kept in Firebase storage.

The site is secure through SSL. Performance is optimized with asynchronous components. SEO is optimized with meta tags. Also, all posts throughout time can be viewed because of an infinite scroll implementation. They can also comment and reply to each other in realtime on their posts and delete or edit all of their content. Users can also tag a topic to their post if they please or view posts on a specific topic. JS cookie and vuex are used to persist state, and Sass is used for the styling.

This is a responsive mobile app that stores a user’s photo of a local plant with MS SQL and Javascript, and then identifies its species with Python. Registered users can also upload their photographs to the appropriate species' page where they can be seen by other users. I worked on the back end, on the RESTful API and Photo class, with Node.js and Express. This was made in an Agile environment, using Git and integration testing.
